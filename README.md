# Design Toolkit

Customise this Figma reference plugin to provide useful resources and automation(s) for yourself or your team. Inspect the code to see how you can customise it for your own needs and publish it for your team to use. 

**Disclaimer**: Things are a bit messy and there are some typescript errors to be addressed. But it does the job, and there was enough interest that I wanted to share it so everyone can have a try building their own toolkit plugin for Figma 🤙

## Features

This plugin template contains several automation examples, including: 

- Create all your document pages
- Insert a cover component with dynamic user information and date
- Insert a heading component on each page, with title and optional description
- Insert custom component(s) on specific pages
- Add links to team resources (e.g. Design System Documentation, Code repos, Comms channels)
## Roadmap

- Basic design linting (Flag elements that don't match your styles/tokens)
- Import/update content strings 
- Workflow checklists, including:
    - Definition of Done
    - Definition of Ready
    - Component best practice


## Installation
Instructions are based off the [quick start instructions](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/quick-start/) from [create-figma-plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin).

Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NoWorries/toolkit-figma-plugin
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd toolkit-figma-plugin
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Configuration options for your plugin go under the "figma-plugin" key of your package.json file.
Modify the `name` that you want to use for your plugin.

```bash
{
  "figma-plugin": {
    "editorType": [
      "figma"
    ],
    // ...
    "name": "Design Toolkit",
    "main": "src/main.ts",
    "ui": "src/ui.tsx"
  }
}
```

To build the plugin:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

This will generate a `manifest.json` file and a build/ directory containing the JavaScript bundle(s) for the plugin.

 - [Plugin Manifest](https://figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/)
 
(Configuring your plugin is done via `package.json`. Avoid manually editing the `manifest.json` file. Because the manifest.json file is always regenerated on build, any changes you make will always get overridden.)
## Run Locally

To watch for code changes and rebuild the plugin automatically:

```bash
$ npm run watch
```

## Installing the plugin
1. In the Figma desktop app, open a Figma document.
2. Search for and run Import plugin from manifest… via the Quick Actions search bar.
3. Select the manifest.json file that was generated by the build script.
## Publishing

When you're happy with your plugin, follow the instructions to publish it.
