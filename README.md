# Design Toolkit

Customise this Figma reference plugin to provide useful resources and automation(s) for yourself or your team. Inspect the code to see how you can customise it for your own needs and publish it for your team to use. 

Made by [@JoshDesignNZ](https://twitter.com/JoshDesignNZ) using [Create Figma Plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/).

**Disclaimer**: Things are a bit messy and there are some typescript errors to be addressed. But it does the job, and there was enough interest that I wanted to share it so everyone can have a try building their own toolkit plugin for Figma. Contributions welcome! ðŸ¤™


## Features

This plugin template contains several automation examples, including: 

- Create all your document pages
- Insert a cover component with dynamic user information and date
- Insert a heading component on each page, with title and optional description
- Insert custom component(s) on specific pages
- Add links to team resources (e.g. Design System Documentation, Code repos, Comms channels)


## Roadmap

- Basic design linting (Flag elements that don't match your styles/tokens)
- Import/update content strings 
- Workflow checklists, including:
    - Definition of Done
    - Definition of Ready
    - Component best practice


## Installation
Instructions are based off the [quick start instructions](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/quick-start/) from [create-figma-plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin).

Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NoWorries/toolkit-figma-plugin
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
cd toolkit-figma-plugin
```

Configuration options for your plugin go under the "figma-plugin" key of your `package.json` file.
Modify both the `name` values that you want to use for your plugin.

The `relaunchButtons` properties will insert a button in the sidebar to easily launch your plugin again.

```bash
{
  "figma-plugin": {
    "editorType": [
      "figma"
    ],
    // ...
    "name": "Design Toolkit",
    "main": "src/main.ts",
    "ui": "src/ui.tsx",
    "relaunchButtons": {
      "designToolkit": {
        "name": "Design Toolkit",
        "main": "src/main.ts",
        "ui": "src/ui.tsx"
      }
    },
  }
}
```

Build the plugin:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `manifest.json` file and a build/ directory containing the JavaScript bundle(s) for the plugin.

 - [Plugin Manifest](https://figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/)
 
Configuring your plugin is done via `package.json`. Avoid manually editing the `manifest.json` file. Because the `manifest.json` file is always regenerated on build, any changes you make will always get overridden.


## Run Locally

To watch for code changes and rebuild the plugin automatically:

```bash
$ npm run watch
```

## Installing the plugin
1. In the Figma desktop app, open a Figma document.
2. Search for and run Import plugin from manifestâ€¦ via the Quick Actions search bar.
3. Select the manifest.json file that was generated by the build script.
4. The plugin can now be launched using either of these methods:
    - Figma > Plugins > Development > Design Toolkit
    - Open the Quick Actions window using `Cmd + /` or `Ctrl + /` and type "Design Toolkit"
